I am too greedy, and always spend considerable time in looking for what makes my life better. However, I forget that my life now is in reality good enough and even preftty fantasic. I should put more efforts into sensing my every moment. I can still wonder about improving myself, but it is also significant to realize what my life be like and what beautiful things I have and people I meet.
