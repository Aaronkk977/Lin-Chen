**Definition of Trees:** a *connected, simple & acyclic* graph

**spanning tree:** a tree derived from a *connect* graph, and has <u>every node</u> of origin graph but <u>all or partial edges</u>.
Balanced: A rooted tree of height $h$'s the level number of every leaf is <u>h−1 or h</u>.
Height: count the edge! not vertices!
#### Properties of trees
1. two distinct nodes has unique one path connects them.
3. $χ(T) = 2$ (graph colouring in [[Graph Theorem]])
4. trees are planar
5. for trees, $|V|=|E|+1$ [important]
6. If a *loop-free connected undirected graph* is not a tree, then $| V |≤| E |$

#### Properties of Complete m-arr trees
1. $n = mi+1$, where n = total nodes in the tree, i = number of internal nodes.
2. $l\leq m^h$
